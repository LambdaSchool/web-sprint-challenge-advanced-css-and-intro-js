1. How would you describe acessibility on the web to someone new to programming?
    Acessibility makes web pages and the internet accessible to everyone. For example: If someone is on a mobile phone 
    and people with disabilities.
2. Talk about 3 different things you can do to ensure your website is accessible. 
    1.Using scalable units to change,for example, the font size.
    2.Color matters especially if someone is colorblind so adding like a symbol when using a form field is helpful.
    3.Having a screen reader where people with disabilities are able to access/listen to what is on a web page.
3. How would you explain the concept of a variable to someone new to programming?
    We use variables as a way to store and change data. For example, when playing a video game there is a score being kept. That score goes from 0 and then changing to 100 and so on so it's storing the points and being chnaged as well.
4. What is the purpose of using functions in code?
    The purpose of using functions is to keep everything organized in stead of just putting all the coding inside a main function.
    Functions can also be used over and over again once it's defined.
